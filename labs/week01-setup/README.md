# Week 1 Lab — Environment Setup

This folder is where your Week 1 work lives. Follow the Week 1 Lab Student Handout
for full instructions; this README is where you record proof that your setup works.

## Setup Verification

Paste the output of the two checkpoint commands from Part 1 of the handout below,
then commit and push this file as part of the `week01-setup` branch / PR.

```
$ python --version
Python 3.11.16

$ python hello_env.py
Your environment is alive.

## Reflection (second PR)

As part of the lab's "second rep," you'll also create a `REFLECTION.md` file in
this same folder on a second branch (`week01-reflection`) and open a second PR.
Don't create it yet — that's Step 10 in Part 3 of the handout.
